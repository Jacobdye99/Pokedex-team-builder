## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
"records": [
    {
      "id": "recAyhG3fAvKhxftw",
      "fields": {
        "username": "Jacob",
        "poke1": "garchomp",
        "image1": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PokeAPI/sprites/master/sprites/pokemon/445.png",

### Opportunities:
To learn more about how React works and Css works
