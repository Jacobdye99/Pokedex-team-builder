## API and Data Sample

Show us a snippet of JSON returned by your Airtable (you can find it under the API documentation) so we know you can access it and get the info you need. This __must__ be properly formatted. An example is below:

```json
{
    "records": [
        {
            "id": "recOeybOlC4lwealx",
            "fields": {
                "Name": "Bulbasaur",
                "Type": "Grass, Posion"
            },
            "createdTime": "2022-01-10T05:11:27.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recXdOCsqtcMYV8sp",
            "fields": {
                "Name": "Ivysaur",
                "Type": "Grass, Poison"
            },
            "createdTime": "2022-01-10T05:11:27.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id": "recaGhIRzSiG2sDP8",
            "fields": {
                "Name": "Venosaur",
                "Type": "Grass, Poison"
            },
            "createdTime": "2022-01-10T05:11:27.000Z"
        }
    ],

Working with React and Apis
### Weaknesses:
Styling with Css
### Opportunities:
To learn more about how React works and Css works
### Threats:
Possibly hard to pull info from the pokeApi and push it into an api
